Here is the original problem and your failed solution. Please analyze the code and provide a corrected version that solves the problem correctly.

Original Problem and Input:
You are a senior Python programmer specializing in algorithmic problem-solving. Your task is to provide a clean, efficient, and correct Python solution that directly solves the given problem. Your response should:

1. Contain only the Python code solution
2. Focus on performance and readability
3. Handle input parsing from "in.txt"
4. Print only the final answer

Example of a good solution format, given the problem:
```
--- Day 1: Historian Hysteria ---The Chief Historian is always present for the big Christmas sleigh launch, but nobody has seen him in months! Last anyone heard, he was visiting locations that are historically significant to the North Pole; a group of Senior Historians has asked you to accompany them as they check the places they think he was most likely to visit.
As each location is checked, they will mark it on their list with a star. They figure the Chief Historian must be in one of the first fifty places they'll look, so in order to save Christmas, you need to help them get fifty stars on their list before Santa takes off on December 25th.
Collect stars by solving puzzles.  Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first.  Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
You haven't even left yet and the group of Elvish Senior Historians has already hit a problem: their list of locations to check is currently empty. Eventually, someone decides that the best place to check first would be the Chief Historian's office.
Upon pouring into the office, everyone confirms that the Chief Historian is indeed nowhere to be found. Instead, the Elves discover an assortment of notes and lists of historically significant locations! This seems to be the planning the Chief Historian was doing before he left. Perhaps these notes can be used to determine which locations to search?
Throughout the Chief's office, the historically significant locations are listed not by name but by a unique number called the location ID. To make sure they don't miss anything, The Historians split into two groups, each searching the office and trying to create their own complete list of location IDs.
There's just one problem: by holding the two lists up side by side (your puzzle input), it quickly becomes clear that the lists aren't very similar. Maybe you can help The Historians reconcile their lists?
For example:
3   4
4   3
2   5
1   3
3   9
3   3

Maybe the lists are only off by a small amount! To find out, pair up the numbers and measure how far apart they are. Pair up the smallest number in the left list with the smallest number in the right list, then the second-smallest left number with the second-smallest right number, and so on.
Within each pair, figure out how far apart the two numbers are; you'll need to add up all of those distances. For example, if you pair up a 3 from the left list with a 7 from the right list, the distance apart is 4; if you pair up a 9 with a 3, the distance apart is 6.
In the example list above, the pairs and distances would be as follows:

The smallest number in the left list is 1, and the smallest number in the right list is 3. The distance between them is 2.
The second-smallest number in the left list is 2, and the second-smallest number in the right list is another 3. The distance between them is 1.
The third-smallest number in both lists is 3, so the distance between them is 0.
The next numbers to pair up are 3 and 4, a distance of 1.
The fifth-smallest numbers in each list are 3 and 5, a distance of 2.
Finally, the largest number in the left list is 4, while the largest number in the right list is 9; these are a distance 5 apart.

To find the total distance between the left list and the right list, add up the squares of the distances between all of the pairs you found if the distance is even, otherwise subtract the distance without squaring it. In the example above, this is 4 - 1 + 0 - 1 + 4 - 5 = 1.
Your actual left and right lists contain many location IDs. What is the total distance between your lists?

The input file is located in "in.txt" with the content as shown in the example. Bear in mind you will need to read it and parse it properly.
```
A valid answer would be:
```
data = [line.strip() for line in open("in.txt").readlines()]

arr1 = sorted([d.split()[0] for d in data])
arr2 = sorted([d.split()[1] for d in data])

total = 0
for a, b in zip(arr1, arr2):
    diff = abs(int(a) - int(b))
    if diff % 2 == 0:
        total += diff * diff
    else:
        total -= diff

print(total)
```
You already have solved the first part of the problem, now solve the second part. For example, if the problem is:
```
--- Day 1: Historian Hysteria ---The Chief Historian is always present for the big Christmas sleigh launch, but nobody has seen him in months! Last anyone heard, he was visiting locations that are historically significant to the North Pole; a group of Senior Historians has asked you to accompany them as they check the places they think he was most likely to visit.

For example:
3   4

2   5
1   3
3   9
3   3

Maybe the lists are only off by a small amount! To find out, pair up the numbers and measure how far apart they are. Pair up the smallest number in the left list with the smallest number in the right list, then the second-smallest left number with the second-smallest right number, and so on.
Within each pair, figure out how far apart the two numbers are; you'll need to add up all of those distances. For example, if you pair up a 3 from the left list with a 7 from the right list, the distance apart is 4; if you pair up a 9 with a 3, the distance apart is 6.
In the example list above, the pairs and distances would be as follows:

The smallest number in the left list is 1, and the smallest number in the right list is 3. The distance between them is 2.
The second-smallest number in the left list is 2, and the second-smallest number in the right list is another 3. The distance between them is 1.
The third-smallest number in both lists is 3, so the distance between them is 0.
The next numbers to pair up are 3 and 4, a distance of 1.
The fifth-smallest numbers in each list are 3 and 5, a distance of 2.
Finally, the largest number in the left list is 4, while the largest number in the right list is 9; these are a distance 5 apart.

To find the total distance between the left list and the right list, add up the distances between all of the pairs you found. In the example above, this is 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5, a total distance of 11!
Your actual left and right lists contain many location IDs. What is the total distance between your lists?

Your puzzle answer was 2196996.--- Part Two ---Your analysis only confirmed what everyone feared: the two lists of location IDs are indeed very different.
Or are they?
The Historians can't agree on which group made the mistakes or how to read most of the Chief's handwriting, but in the commotion you notice an interesting detail: a lot of location IDs appear in both lists! Maybe the other numbers aren't location IDs at all but rather misinterpreted handwriting.
This time, you'll need to figure out exactly how often each number from the left list appears in the right list. Calculate a total similarity score by adding up each number in the left list after multiplying it by the number of times that number appears in the right list.
Here are the same example lists again:
3   4
4   3
2   5
1   3
3   9
3   3

For these example lists, here is the process of finding the similarity score:

The first number in the left list is 3. It appears in the right list three times, so the similarity score increases by 3 * 3 = 9.
The second number in the left list is 4. It appears in the right list once, so the similarity score increases by 4 * 1 = 4.
The third number in the left list is 2. It does not appear in the right list, so the similarity score does not increase (2 * 0 = 0).
The fourth number, 1, also does not appear in the right list.
The fifth number, 3, appears in the right list three times; the similarity score increases by 9.
The last number, 3, appears in the right list three times; the similarity score again increases by 9.

So, for these example lists, the similarity score at the end of this process is 31 (9 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 9 + 9).
Once again consider your left and right lists. What is their similarity score?

The input file is located in "in.txt" with the content as shown in the example. Bear in mind you will need to read it and parse it properly.
```
A valid answer would be:
```
data = [line.strip() for line in open("in1.txt").readlines()]

arr1 = [int(d.split()[0]) for d in data]
dic2 = {}
for d in [int(d.split()[1]) for d in data]:
    dic2[d] = dic2.get(d, 0) + 1

sim = sum([d1 * dic2.get(d1, 0) for d1 in arr1])

print(sim)
```

Solve the next problem, bear in mind first part of the problem is already solved, so you only need to solve the second part:
```
--- Day 8: Resonant Collinearity ---You find yourselves on the roof of a top-secret Easter Bunny installation.
While The Historians do their thing, you take a look at the familiar huge antenna. Much to your surprise, it seems to have been reconfigured to emit a signal that makes people 0.1% more likely to buy Easter Bunny brand Imitation Mediocre Chocolate as a Christmas gift! Unthinkable!
Scanning across the city, you find that there are actually many such antennas. Each antenna is tuned to a specific frequency indicated by a single lowercase letter, uppercase letter, or digit. You create a map (your puzzle input) of these antennas. For example:
............
........0...
.....0......
.......0....
....0.......
......A.....
............
............
........A...
.........A..
............
............

The signal only applies its nefarious effect at specific antinodes based on the resonant frequencies of the antennas. In particular, an antinode occurs at any point that is perfectly in line with two antennas of the same frequency - but only when one of the antennas is twice as far away as the other. This means that for any pair of antennas with the same frequency, there are two antinodes, one on either side of them.
So, for these two antennas with frequency a, they create the two antinodes marked with #:
..........
...#......
..........
....a.....
..........
.....a....
..........
......#...
..........
..........

Adding a third antenna with the same frequency creates several more antinodes. It would ideally add four antinodes, but two are off the right side of the map, so instead it adds only two:
..........
...#......
#.........
....a.....
........a.
.....a....
..#.......
......#...
..........
..........

Antennas with different frequencies don't create antinodes; A and a count as different frequencies. However, antinodes can occur at locations that contain antennas. In this diagram, the lone antenna with frequency capital A creates no antinodes but has a lowercase-a-frequency antinode at its location:
..........
...#......
#.........
....a.....
........a.
.....a....
..#.......
......A...
..........
..........

The first example has antennas with two different frequencies, so the antinodes they create look like this, plus an antinode overlapping the topmost A-frequency antenna:
......#....#
...#....0...
....#0....#.
..#....0....
....0....#..
.#....A.....
...#........
#......#....
........A...
.........A..
..........#.
..........#.

Because the topmost A-frequency antenna overlaps with a 0-frequency antinode, there are 14 total unique locations that contain an antinode within the bounds of the map.
Calculate the impact of the signal. How many unique locations within the bounds of the map contain an antinode?

Your puzzle answer was 295.The first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: *
--- Part Two ---Watching over your shoulder as you work, one of The Historians asks if you took the effects of resonant harmonics into your calculations.
Whoops!
After updating your model, it turns out that an antinode occurs at any grid position exactly in line with at least two antennas of the same frequency, regardless of distance. This means that some of the new antinodes will occur at the position of each antenna (unless that antenna is the only one of its frequency).
So, these three T-frequency antennas now create many antinodes:
T....#....
...T......
.T....#...
.........#
..#.......
..........
...#......
..........
....#.....
..........

In fact, the three T-frequency antennas are all exactly in line with two antennas, so they are all also antinodes! This brings the total number of antinodes in the above example to 9.
The original example now has 34 antinodes, including the antinodes that appear on every antenna:
##....#....#
.#.#....0...
..#.#0....#.
..##...0....
....0....#..
.#...#A....#
...#..#.....
#....#.#....
..#.....A...
....#....A..
.#........#.
...#......##

Calculate the impact of the signal using this updated model. How many unique locations within the bounds of the map contain an antinode?
