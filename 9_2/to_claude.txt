You are a senior Python programmer specializing in algorithmic problem-solving. Your task is to provide a clean, efficient, and correct Python solution that directly solves the given problem. Your response should:

1. Contain only the Python code solution
2. Focus on performance and readability
3. Handle input parsing from "in.txt"
4. Print only the final answer

Example of a good solution format, given the problem:
```
--- Day 1: Historian Hysteria ---The Chief Historian is always present for the big Christmas sleigh launch, but nobody has seen him in months! Last anyone heard, he was visiting locations that are historically significant to the North Pole; a group of Senior Historians has asked you to accompany them as they check the places they think he was most likely to visit.
As each location is checked, they will mark it on their list with a star. They figure the Chief Historian must be in one of the first fifty places they'll look, so in order to save Christmas, you need to help them get fifty stars on their list before Santa takes off on December 25th.
Collect stars by solving puzzles.  Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first.  Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
You haven't even left yet and the group of Elvish Senior Historians has already hit a problem: their list of locations to check is currently empty. Eventually, someone decides that the best place to check first would be the Chief Historian's office.
Upon pouring into the office, everyone confirms that the Chief Historian is indeed nowhere to be found. Instead, the Elves discover an assortment of notes and lists of historically significant locations! This seems to be the planning the Chief Historian was doing before he left. Perhaps these notes can be used to determine which locations to search?
Throughout the Chief's office, the historically significant locations are listed not by name but by a unique number called the location ID. To make sure they don't miss anything, The Historians split into two groups, each searching the office and trying to create their own complete list of location IDs.
There's just one problem: by holding the two lists up side by side (your puzzle input), it quickly becomes clear that the lists aren't very similar. Maybe you can help The Historians reconcile their lists?
For example:
3   4
4   3
2   5
1   3
3   9
3   3

Maybe the lists are only off by a small amount! To find out, pair up the numbers and measure how far apart they are. Pair up the smallest number in the left list with the smallest number in the right list, then the second-smallest left number with the second-smallest right number, and so on.
Within each pair, figure out how far apart the two numbers are; you'll need to add up all of those distances. For example, if you pair up a 3 from the left list with a 7 from the right list, the distance apart is 4; if you pair up a 9 with a 3, the distance apart is 6.
In the example list above, the pairs and distances would be as follows:

The smallest number in the left list is 1, and the smallest number in the right list is 3. The distance between them is 2.
The second-smallest number in the left list is 2, and the second-smallest number in the right list is another 3. The distance between them is 1.
The third-smallest number in both lists is 3, so the distance between them is 0.
The next numbers to pair up are 3 and 4, a distance of 1.
The fifth-smallest numbers in each list are 3 and 5, a distance of 2.
Finally, the largest number in the left list is 4, while the largest number in the right list is 9; these are a distance 5 apart.

To find the total distance between the left list and the right list, add up the squares of the distances between all of the pairs you found if the distance is even, otherwise subtract the distance without squaring it. In the example above, this is 4 - 1 + 0 - 1 + 4 - 5 = 1.
Your actual left and right lists contain many location IDs. What is the total distance between your lists?

The input file is located in "in.txt" with the content as shown in the example. Bear in mind you will need to read it and parse it properly.
```
A valid answer would be:
```
data = [line.strip() for line in open("in.txt").readlines()]

arr1 = sorted([d.split()[0] for d in data])
arr2 = sorted([d.split()[1] for d in data])

total = 0
for a, b in zip(arr1, arr2):
    diff = abs(int(a) - int(b))
    if diff % 2 == 0:
        total += diff * diff
    else:
        total -= diff

print(total)
```
You already have solved the first part of the problem, now solve the second part. For example, if the problem is:
```
--- Day 1: Historian Hysteria ---The Chief Historian is always present for the big Christmas sleigh launch, but nobody has seen him in months! Last anyone heard, he was visiting locations that are historically significant to the North Pole; a group of Senior Historians has asked you to accompany them as they check the places they think he was most likely to visit.

Maybe the lists are only off by a small amount! To find out, pair up the numbers and measure how far apart they are. Pair up the smallest number in the left list with the smallest number in the right list, then the second-smallest left number with the second-smallest right number, and so on.

In the example list above, the pairs and distances would be as follows:

The smallest number in the left list is 1, and the smallest number in the right list is 3. The distance between them is 2.
The second-smallest number in the left list is 2, and the second-smallest number in the right list is another 3. The distance between them is 1.
The third-smallest number in both lists is 3, so the distance between them is 0.
The next numbers to pair up are 3 and 4, a distance of 1.
The fifth-smallest numbers in each list are 3 and 5, a distance of 2.
Finally, the largest number in the left list is 4, while the largest number in the right list is 9; these are a distance 5 apart.

To find the total distance between the left list and the right list, add up the distances between all of the pairs you found. In the example above, this is 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5, a total distance of 11!
Your actual left and right lists contain many location IDs. What is the total distance between your lists?

Your puzzle answer was 2196996.--- Part Two ---Your analysis only confirmed what everyone feared: the two lists of location IDs are indeed very different.
Or are they?
The Historians can't agree on which group made the mistakes or how to read most of the Chief's handwriting, but in the commotion you notice an interesting detail: a lot of location IDs appear in both lists! Maybe the other numbers aren't location IDs at all but rather misinterpreted handwriting.
This time, you'll need to figure out exactly how often each number from the left list appears in the right list. Calculate a total similarity score by adding up each number in the left list after multiplying it by the number of times that number appears in the right list.
Here are the same example lists again:
3   4
4   3
2   5
1   3
3   9
3   3

For these example lists, here is the process of finding the similarity score:

The first number in the left list is 3. It appears in the right list three times, so the similarity score increases by 3 * 3 = 9.
The second number in the left list is 4. It appears in the right list once, so the similarity score increases by 4 * 1 = 4.
The third number in the left list is 2. It does not appear in the right list, so the similarity score does not increase (2 * 0 = 0).
The fourth number, 1, also does not appear in the right list.
The fifth number, 3, appears in the right list three times; the similarity score increases by 9.
The last number, 3, appears in the right list three times; the similarity score again increases by 9.

So, for these example lists, the similarity score at the end of this process is 31 (9 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 9 + 9).
Once again consider your left and right lists. What is their similarity score?

The input file is located in "in.txt" with the content as shown in the example. Bear in mind you will need to read it and parse it properly.
```
A valid answer would be:
```
data = [line.strip() for line in open("in1.txt").readlines()]

arr1 = [int(d.split()[0]) for d in data]
dic2 = {}
for d in [int(d.split()[1]) for d in data]:
    dic2[d] = dic2.get(d, 0) + 1

sim = sum([d1 * dic2.get(d1, 0) for d1 in arr1])

print(sim)
```

Solve the next problem, bear in mind first part of the problem is already solved, so you only need to solve the second part:
```
--- Day 9: Disk Fragmenter ---Another push of the button leaves you in the familiar hallways of some friendly amphipods! Good thing you each somehow got your own personal mini submarine. The Historians jet away in search of the Chief, mostly by driving directly into walls.
While The Historians quickly figure out how to pilot these things, you notice an amphipod in the corner struggling with his computer. He's trying to make more contiguous free space by compacting all of the files, but his program isn't working; you offer to help.
He shows you the disk map (your puzzle input) he's already generated. For example:
2333133121414131402
The disk map uses a dense format to represent the layout of files and free space on the disk. The digits alternate between indicating the length of a file and the length of free space.
So, a disk map like 12345 would represent a one-block file, two blocks of free space, a three-block file, four blocks of free space, and then a five-block file. A disk map like 90909 would represent three nine-block files in a row (with no free space between them).
Each file on disk also has an ID number based on the order of the files as they appear before they are rearranged, starting with ID 0. So, the disk map 12345 has three files: a one-block file with ID 0, a three-block file with ID 1, and a five-block file with ID 2. Using one character for each block where digits are the file ID and . is free space, the disk map 12345 represents these individual blocks:
0..111....22222
The first example above, 2333133121414131402, represents these individual blocks:
00...111...2...333.44.5555.6666.777.888899
The amphipod would like to move file blocks one at a time from the end of the disk to the leftmost free space block (until there are no gaps remaining between file blocks). For the disk map 12345, the process looks like this:
0..111....22222
02.111....2222.
022111....222..
0221112...22...
02211122..2....
022111222......

The first example requires a few more steps:
00...111...2...333.44.5555.6666.777.888899
009..111...2...333.44.5555.6666.777.88889.
0099.111...2...333.44.5555.6666.777.8888..
00998111...2...333.44.5555.6666.777.888...
009981118..2...333.44.5555.6666.777.88....
0099811188.2...333.44.5555.6666.777.8.....
009981118882...333.44.5555.6666.777.......
0099811188827..333.44.5555.6666.77........
00998111888277.333.44.5555.6666.7.........
009981118882777333.44.5555.6666...........
009981118882777333644.5555.666............
00998111888277733364465555.66.............
0099811188827773336446555566..............

The final step of this file-compacting process is to update the filesystem checksum. To calculate the checksum, add up the result of multiplying each of these blocks' position with the file ID number it contains. The leftmost block is in position 0. If a block contains free space, skip it instead.
Continuing the first example, the first few blocks' position multiplied by its file ID number are 0 * 0 = 0, 1 * 0 = 0, 2 * 9 = 18, 3 * 9 = 27, 4 * 8 = 32, and so on. In this example, the checksum is the sum of these, 1928.
Compact the amphipod's hard drive using the process he requested. What is the resulting filesystem checksum? (Be careful copy/pasting the input for this puzzle; it is a single, very long line.)

Your puzzle answer was 6463499258318.The first half of this puzzle is complete! It provides one gold star: *
--- Part Two ---Upon completion, two things immediately become clear. First, the disk definitely has a lot more contiguous free space, just like the amphipod hoped. Second, the computer is running much more slowly! Maybe introducing all of that file system fragmentation was a bad idea?
The eager amphipod already has a new plan: rather than move individual blocks, he'd like to try compacting the files on his disk by moving whole files instead.
This time, attempt to move whole files to the leftmost span of free space blocks that could fit the file. Attempt to move each file exactly once in order of decreasing file ID number starting with the file with the highest file ID number. If there is no span of free space to the left of a file that is large enough to fit the file, the file does not move.
The first example from above now proceeds differently:
00...111...2...333.44.5555.6666.777.888899
0099.111...2...333.44.5555.6666.777.8888..
0099.1117772...333.44.5555.6666.....8888..
0099.111777244.333....5555.6666.....8888..
00992111777.44.333....5555.6666.....8888..

The process of updating the filesystem checksum is the same; now, this example's checksum would be 2858.
Start over, now compacting the amphipod's hard drive using this new method instead. What is the resulting filesystem checksum?
